					<h1>Do's:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Stay informed: Keep updated with weather forecasts and warnings from reliable sources like the National Weather Service or local meteorological departments to know when a cold wave is expected and how severe it might be.</li>

<li>Dress warmly: Wear multiple layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one heavy layer. Make sure to cover extremities with hats, gloves, scarves, and thermal socks. Waterproof and windproof outer layers are ideal.</li>

<li>Insulate your home: Ensure that your home is well-insulated. Use weather stripping around doors and windows to prevent drafts. Close curtains or blinds to retain heat.</li>

<li>Maintain heating equipment: Ensure your heating equipment is in good working condition. Have your furnace inspected and cleaned. If using space heaters, ensure they are safe and placed away from flammable materials.</li>

<li>Stock emergency supplies: Keep a supply of non-perishable food, water, medications, batteries, flashlights, and a first aid kit in case of power outages or emergencies.</li>

<li>Stay indoors: Limit time spent outdoors during extreme cold. If you must go outside, stay as dry as possible since wet clothing chills the body rapidly.</li>

<li>Heat your home safely: Use fireplaces, wood stoves, or space heaters properly. Ensure adequate ventilation to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby and know how to use it.</li>

<li>Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Warm beverages can help maintain body temperature.</li>

<li>Check on vulnerable individuals: Regularly check on elderly neighbors, young children, and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses who may need help during extreme cold.</li>

<li>Prepare your vehicle: If you need to travel, make sure your vehicle is winterized with antifreeze, a full tank of gas, and an emergency kit including blankets, food, water, and a shovel.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Don'ts:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don't ignore weather warnings: Take cold wave warnings seriously and follow advice from local authorities.</li>

<li>Don't overexert yourself: Avoid strenuous activities like shoveling snow or walking in deep snow, which can strain your heart. Take breaks and work slowly.</li>

<li>Don't use unsafe heating methods: Avoid using ovens, charcoal grills, or portable gasoline heaters indoors as they can produce dangerous carbon monoxide fumes.</li>

<li>Don't leave pets outside: Bring pets indoors or ensure they have adequate warm shelter and access to unfrozen water.</li>

<li>Don't neglect your pipes: Let faucets drip a little to avoid freezing pipes. Know how to shut off water valves in case of burst pipes.</li>

<li>Don't leave your car running in an enclosed space: Never run your car inside a garage or other enclosed space, as this can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>

<li>Don't venture out unprepared: If you must go outside, dress in appropriate clothing and limit the time spent in the cold. Carry a fully charged cell phone in case of emergencies.</li>

<li>Don't forget to check smoke and carbon monoxide detectors: Ensure that all smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working correctly to provide early warnings in case of fires or gas leaks.</li>

<li>Don't consume alcohol: Avoid drinking alcohol, as it can cause your body to lose heat more rapidly and impair your judgment regarding exposure to the cold.</li>

<li>Don't ignore symptoms of cold-related illnesses: Be aware of the signs of hypothermia (shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech) and frostbite (numbness, white or grayish-yellow skin, firm or waxy skin). Seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.</li>

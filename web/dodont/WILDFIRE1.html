			<li>Maintain Defensible Space: Clear a defensible space around your home by removing dead vegetation, trimming trees, and clearing leaves and debris from gutters.</li>
			<li>Use Fire-Resistant Materials: Use fire-resistant materials for roofing, siding, and decks to reduce the risk of fire spreading to your home.</li>

			<li>Evacuate Early: If evacuation orders are issued, leave immediately. Don’t wait until the last minute.</li>
			<li>Protect Your Home: Close all windows and doors to prevent embers from entering. Move flammable furniture away from windows.</li>
			<li>Wear Protective Clothing: Wear long sleeves, long pants, sturdy shoes, gloves, and a mask to protect yourself from smoke and heat.</li>
			<li>Stay Low: If you are caught in a wildfire, stay low to the ground to avoid smoke inhalation.</li>

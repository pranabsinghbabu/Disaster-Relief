			 <!-- page 1 -->
			  <h1>Before a Flood</h1>
			<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Know Your Risk: Find out if you live in a flood-prone area. Check flood maps and local weather alerts.</li>
			<li>Create an Emergency Plan: Develop a family emergency plan. Include evacuation routes and communication plans.</li>
			<li>Prepare an Emergency Kit: Include essentials such as water, non-perishable food, medications, flashlights, batteries, first aid supplies, important documents, and cash.</li>
			<li>Purchase Flood Insurance: Consider getting flood insurance if you live in a high-risk area.</li>
			<li>Secure Your Home: Elevate electrical appliances and utilities, install sump pumps, and seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds.</li>
			<li>Keep Important Documents Safe: Store important documents in a waterproof container or digitally on a cloud service.</li>
			<li>Stay Informed: Monitor weather reports and sign up for local alerts to stay updated on flood conditions.</li>
			<li>Plan for Pets: Make sure you have a plan for your pets in case you need to evacuate.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Ignore Flood Risks: Don't assume you are safe from floods if you haven’t experienced one before.</li>
			<li>Neglect Maintenance: Don’t neglect regular maintenance and checks of your home’s drainage systems and gutters.</li>
			<li>Rely Solely on Homeowners Insurance: Standard homeowners insurance does not typically cover flood damage; don't overlook the need for separate flood insurance.</li>
			<li>Forget to Back Up Data: Don’t forget to back up important digital documents and family photos in case they are lost in a flood.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>During a Flood</h1>
			<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Stay Informed: Continuously monitor weather reports and emergency alerts.</li>
			<li>Move to Higher Ground: If there is a flood warning, move to higher ground immediately.</li>
			<li>Evacuate if Advised: Follow evacuation orders from local authorities without delay.</li>
			<li>Turn Off Utilities: If time permits, turn off utilities such as gas, electricity, and water to prevent damage.</li>
			<li>Avoid Floodwaters: Stay away from floodwaters, which may be contaminated or electrically charged.</li>
			<li>Wear Protective Gear: Wear sturdy shoes, gloves, and other protective clothing if you need to walk through flood-affected areas.</li>
			<li>Keep Your Phone Charged: Ensure your phone is charged for communication and emergency updates.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Don’t Walk or Drive Through Floodwaters: Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of water can sweep your vehicle away.</li>
			<li>Don’t Ignore Evacuation Orders: Don’t stay in your home if authorities advise you to evacuate.</li>
			<li>Avoid Using Electrical Appliances: Don’t use electrical appliances that have been in contact with water.</li>
			<li>Don’t Touch Electrical Equipment: Avoid touching electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>After a Flood</h1>
			<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Wait for Official Declaration: Return home only when authorities have declared it safe.</li>
			<li>Check for Structural Damage: Inspect your home for structural damage before entering.</li>
			<li>Document Damage: Take photos and videos of the damage for insurance claims.</li>
			<li>Wear Protective Clothing: Wear rubber boots, gloves, and masks when cleaning up to protect from contaminants.</li>
			<li>Remove Water Safely: Pump out flooded basements gradually (about one-third of the water per day) to avoid structural damage.</li>
			<li>Clean and Disinfect: Clean and disinfect everything that got wet to prevent mold growth and contamination.</li>
			<li>Boil Water: Boil drinking water until authorities declare the water supply safe.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Don’t Ignore Health Hazards: Don’t ignore signs of mold growth or contamination; they can cause serious health issues.</li>
			<li>Don’t Use Flooded Appliances: Don’t use electrical appliances that have been in contact with water until they have been inspected and declared safe.</li>
			<li>Avoid Flood-Damaged Roads: Don’t drive on roads that have been damaged or covered by floodwaters.</li>
			<li>Don’t Dispose of Flood Debris Improperly: Follow local guidelines for disposing of flood-damaged items and debris.</li>
			  </ol>

			 <h1>After an Earthquake</h1>
				<h2>Do's:</h2>
				<ol>
				<li>Check for Injuries: Attend to your injuries first, then assist others if possible. Use first aid supplies if needed.</li>
				<li>Inspect for Hazards: Look out for hazards such as gas leaks, damaged electrical lines, or structural damage.</li>
				<li>Use Phones for Emergencies Only: Keep phone lines clear for emergency communications.</li>
				<li>Follow Emergency Instructions: Listen to emergency broadcasts and follow instructions from authorities.</li>
				<li>Be Prepared for Aftershocks: Aftershocks can occur; be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On again.		</li>		
				<li>Check Utilities: If you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off the gas supply and report it to authorities. Do not use electrical devices if you suspect a gas leak.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
				<ol>
				<li>Don’t Use Open Flames: Avoid using candles, matches, or lighters until you are sure there are no gas leaks.</li>
				<li>Don’t Enter Damaged Buildings: Stay away from damaged structures until they have been inspected and deemed safe.</li>
				<li>Don’t Turn on Electrical Appliances: Avoid turning on electrical appliances until you are sure there are no gas leaks or electrical damage.</li>
				<li>Don’t Drink Tap Water: Avoid drinking tap water until it has been declared safe by authorities.</li>
				<li>Avoid Driving: Do not drive unless absolutely necessary to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles.</li>
              </ol>
             <h1> Before an Earthquake</h1>
			<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Create an Emergency Plan: Develop a family emergency plan and make sure all family members know what to do during an earthquake.</li>
			<li>Prepare an Emergency Kit: Include essentials like water, non-perishable food, flashlight, batteries, first aid supplies, medications, and important documents.</li>
			<li>Secure Heavy Items: Anchor heavy furniture, appliances, and other large items to walls. Use straps and brackets to prevent them from falling.</li>
			<li>Know Safe Spots: Identify safe spots in each room, such as under sturdy furniture, against an interior wall, and away from windows.</li>
			<li>Conduct Drills: Practice earthquake drills regularly to ensure everyone knows how to react.</li>
			<li>Learn First Aid: Basic first aid knowledge can be crucial in the aftermath of an earthquake.</li>
			<li>Inspect Your Home: Check the structure of your home and retrofit if necessary, especially if you live in an older building.</li>
			</ol>  
			
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Ignore Risks: Don’t assume an earthquake won’t happen; prepare regardless of perceived risk.</li>
			<li>Leave Heavy Items Unsecured: Avoid leaving heavy objects on high shelves where they can fall and cause injury.</li>
			<li>Forget Emergency Contacts: Don’t neglect to have a list of emergency contacts readily available.</li>
			<li>Ignore Your Building’s Vulnerabilities: Don’t ignore signs of structural weakness or fail to make necessary reinforcements.</li>  
			</ol>		
              
			  <h1>During an Earthquake</h1>
				<h2>Do's:</h2>
				<ol>
				<li>Drop, Cover, and Hold On: Drop to your hands and knees, take cover under sturdy furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
				<li>Stay Indoors: If you are inside, stay inside. Move to a safe spot like under a table.</li>
				<li>Protect Your Head and Neck: Use your arms to shield your head and neck from falling debris.</li>
				<li>Move Away from Windows: Get away from glass, windows, outside doors, and walls.</li>
				<li>Stay in Bed if You Are There: If you are in bed, stay there. Protect your head with a pillow.</li>
				<li>Use the Stairs: If you need to leave a building, use the stairs, not the elevator.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
				<ol>
				<li>Don’t Run Outside: It is safer to stay inside and find cover than to run outside during the shaking.</li>
				<li>Avoid Doorways: Contrary to popular belief, doorways are not the safest place. They do not provide protection from flying or falling objects.</li>
				<li>Don’t Stand Under Heavy Fixtures: Avoid standing under heavy light fixtures, ceiling fans, or anything that might fall.</li>
				</ol>

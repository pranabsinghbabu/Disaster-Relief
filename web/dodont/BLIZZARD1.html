			 <!-- page 1 -->
			<h1>Do's:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Stay indoors: If possible, remain indoors during a blizzard to avoid exposure to extreme cold and hazardous conditions.</li>

			<li>Keep informed: Stay updated on weather forecasts and warnings through local news, radio, or weather apps to know when a blizzard is expected and how long it might last.</li>

			<li>Prepare an emergency kit: Stock up on essential supplies such as non-perishable food, water, medications, batteries, flashlights, blankets, and a first aid kit in case of power outages or being snowed in.</li>

			<li>Dress warmly: Wear multiple layers of clothing, including a hat, gloves, scarf, and waterproof boots, to stay warm if you need to go outside or in case heating fails indoors.</li>

			<li>Insulate your home: Seal any drafts, close curtains or blinds to trap heat, and use draft stoppers at doors to prevent cold air from entering your home.</li>

			<li>Have a backup heating source: If possible, have an alternative heating source such as a fireplace, wood stove, or space heater available, but ensure it is used safely and ventilated properly to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>

			<li>Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, including warm beverages, to stay hydrated during the cold weather.</li>

			<li>Charge electronic devices: Keep your cell phone, laptop, and other electronic devices fully charged in case of power outages.</li>

			<li>Stay in touch: Keep in touch with family, friends, and neighbors, especially those who may need assistance during the blizzard.</li>

			<li>Be prepared for emergencies: Have a plan in place for emergencies, including how to evacuate if necessary, and keep important documents and emergency contacts easily accessible.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Don'ts:</h1>
			<ol>
			<li>Don't travel unless absolutely necessary: Avoid driving or walking outside during a blizzard unless it is an emergency. Visibility can be severely reduced, and roads may be icy or impassable.</li>

			<li>Don't ignore official warnings: Take blizzard warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities and emergency services.</li>

			<li>Don't overexert yourself: Shoveling heavy snow or trying to clear blocked pathways can be physically demanding. Take breaks, pace yourself, and avoid overexertion to prevent injury or exhaustion.</li>

			<li>Don't use outdoor heating sources indoors: Never use portable generators, charcoal grills, camp stoves, or other fuel-burning devices indoors, as they can produce deadly carbon monoxide gas.</li>

			<li>Don't leave pets outside: Bring pets indoors or provide them with adequate shelter and protection from the cold during a blizzard.</li>

			<li>Don't leave fires unattended: If using a fireplace or wood stove for heat, never leave it unattended, and ensure that ashes are disposed of safely.</li>

			<li>Don't ignore signs of frostbite or hypothermia: Be aware of symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or discolored skin, and seek medical attention immediately if you or someone else shows signs of cold-related injuries.</li>

			<li>Don't rely solely on technology: While electronic devices can be helpful for communication and staying informed, they may not always be available during a power outage. Have alternative methods of communication and information available, such as a battery-powered radio.</li>

			<li>Don't forget to check on vulnerable individuals: Keep an eye out for elderly neighbors, young children, and individuals with disabilities who may need assistance during extreme weather conditions.</li>

			<li>Don't panic: Stay calm and follow your emergency plan if conditions worsen. Remaining calm can help you make rational decisions and stay safe during a blizzard.</li>

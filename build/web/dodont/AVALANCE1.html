			 <!-- page 1 -->
							<h1>Do's:</h1>
					<ol>
				<li>Get educated: Take an avalanche safety course to learn about avalanche terrain recognition, snowpack evaluation, route finding, rescue techniques, and safe travel practices in avalanche terrain.</li>

				<li>Check avalanche forecasts: Before heading into avalanche terrain, check local avalanche forecasts and weather conditions to assess the risk level and make informed decisions.</li>

				<li>Carry essential avalanche gear: Always carry the necessary avalanche safety equipment, including an avalanche transceiver (also known as a beacon), probe, and shovel. Make sure you know how to properly use this equipment.</li>

				<li>Travel with partners: Never travel alone in avalanche terrain. Always go with at least one partner, preferably more, and stay within visual and voice contact of each other.</li>

				<li>Practice safe travel techniques: Move one at a time through avalanche terrain, minimizing exposure to avalanche hazards. Avoid crossing under or stopping above avalanche paths.</li>

				<li>Communicate effectively: Establish clear communication protocols with your partners, including predetermined meeting points, signals, and emergency procedures.</li>

				<li>Watch for warning signs: Be vigilant for signs of unstable snow, such as recent avalanches, cracking or collapsing of the snowpack, and visible signs of wind-loading or snowdrifts.</li>

				<li>Stay informed about changing conditions: Continuously assess snowpack stability and terrain features as you travel, and be prepared to adjust your plans or turn back if conditions deteriorate.</li>

				<li>Know how to self-rescue: Practice self-rescue techniques, including deploying your avalanche transceiver, probing, and digging efficiently. Carry a rescue kit and know how to use it effectively.</li>

				<li>Report observations: Share your observations and experiences with local avalanche forecast centers or authorities to contribute to the overall understanding of avalanche conditions in the area.</li>
				</ol>
				<h1>Don'ts:</h1>
				<ol>

				<li>Don't ignore avalanche warnings: Take avalanche warnings seriously and avoid traveling in avalanche terrain when the risk level is high or unstable conditions exist.</li>

				<li>Don't rely solely on avalanche gear: While essential, avalanche safety equipment is not a guarantee of safety. Proper training, good decision-making, and safe travel practices are equally important.</li>

				<li>Don't assume stability: Even if conditions seem safe or stable, always err on the side of caution and treat avalanche terrain with respect. Avalanche hazards can exist even in seemingly benign terrain.</li>

				<li>Don't travel blindly: Avoid blindly following tracks or routes without assessing the current snowpack and avalanche conditions. Conditions can change rapidly, and tracks may lead into hazardous terrain.</li>

				<li>Don't underestimate the terrain: Respect the complexity of avalanche terrain and recognize that even small slopes or gullies can produce dangerous avalanches under the right conditions.</li>

				<li>Don't overcrowd slopes: Avoid traveling in large groups or congregating in one area, as this can increase the load on the snowpack and the risk of triggering an avalanche.</li>

				<li>Don't delay in an emergency: If caught in an avalanche, act quickly to deploy your avalanche transceiver, signal for help, and initiate a rescue. Time is of the essence in avalanche rescues.</li>

				<li>Don't forget to practice: Regularly practice avalanche rescue drills with your partners to maintain proficiency and ensure a swift and effective response in case of an emergency.</li>

				<li>Don't ignore your instincts: Trust your gut feelings and intuition about the safety of the terrain and conditions. If something doesn't feel right, don't hesitate to change your plans or turn back.</li>

				<li>Don't neglect to debrief: After each outing in avalanche terrain, take the time to debrief with your partners, discussing what went well, what could be improved, and any lessons learned for future trips.</li>

			 <!-- page 1 -->
			<h1> Before a Tornado</h1>
				<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Know Your Risk: Understand the tornado risk in your area. Familiarize yourself with the signs of an approaching tornado and the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning.</li>
			<li>Create an Emergency Plan: Develop a family emergency plan that includes identifying safe rooms or storm shelters, knowing how to turn off utilities, and having a communication plan.</li>
			<li>Prepare an Emergency Kit: Include essentials such as water, non-perishable food, medications, flashlights, batteries, first aid supplies, important documents, and cash.</li>
			<li>Stay Informed: Sign up for local weather alerts and monitor weather forecasts regularly, especially during tornado season.</li>
			<li>Secure Your Home: Reinforce your home, especially roofs and doors. Secure outdoor objects that could become projectiles.</li>
			<li>Identify Safe Places: Know the safest place in your home to take shelter, such as a basement, storm cellar, or an interior room on the lowest floor without windows.</li>
			<li>Practice Drills: Conduct regular tornado drills with your family to ensure everyone knows what to do and where to go.</li>
			<li>Install NOAA Weather Radio: Have a NOAA weather radio with an alarm feature to receive alerts.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>

			<li>Ignore Tornado Risks: Don’t assume you’re safe from tornadoes if they haven’t occurred in your area recently.</li>
			<li>Leave Loose Objects Outside: Don’t leave outdoor furniture, tools, or toys unsecured as they can become dangerous projectiles.</li>
			<li>Neglect Maintenance: Don’t ignore structural weaknesses in your home that could be reinforced.</li>
			<li>Forget About Pets: Don’t forget to include pets in your emergency planning.</li>
			
			<h1>During a Tornado</h1>
			<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Seek Shelter Immediately: If a tornado warning is issued, take shelter immediately in a safe location.</li>
			<li>Use the Sturdiest Shelter Available: Go to a basement, storm cellar, or an interior room on the lowest floor away from windows and exterior walls.</li>
			<li>Protect Your Head and Neck: Use a mattress, heavy blankets, or a helmet to protect yourself from debris.</li>
			<li>Listen for Updates: Use a battery-powered weather radio or mobile app to receive updates and information.</li>
			<li>Cover Yourself: If possible, get under sturdy furniture and use your arms to protect your head and neck.</li>
			<li>Stay Indoors: Stay inside until the tornado has passed and it’s safe to come out.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Don’t Stay in a Mobile Home: Mobile homes are not safe during a tornado. Seek sturdier shelter immediately.</li>
			<li>Avoid Windows: Don’t stand near windows or glass doors, as they can shatter.</li>
			<li>Don’t Try to Outrun a Tornado in a Vehicle: It’s safer to abandon your vehicle and seek shelter in a sturdy building or a low-lying area.</li>
			<li>Don’t Go Outside: Don’t leave your shelter until you are sure the tornado has passed and it is safe to do so.</li>
			</ol>
		<h1>After a Tornado</h1>
			<h2>Do's:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Check for Injuries: Check yourself and others for injuries. Administer first aid if necessary and call for emergency medical help if needed.</li>
			<li>Inspect Your Home: Check your home for structural damage before re-entering. Be cautious of downed power lines, broken glass, and other hazards.</li>
			<li>Listen for Updates: Continue to monitor local news and weather updates for information on further storms and safety instructions.</li>
			<li>Document Damage: Take photos and videos of the damage for insurance purposes.</li>
			<li>Stay Safe: Be aware of potential hazards such as gas leaks, electrical hazards, and structural damage.</li>
			<li>Follow Official Instructions: Follow the instructions of local authorities regarding safety and recovery efforts.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Don’ts:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Don’t Use Matches or Lighters: Avoid using open flames until you are sure there are no gas leaks.</li>
			<li>Avoid Downed Power Lines: Don’t touch downed power lines or objects in contact with them.</li>
			<li>Don’t Enter Damaged Buildings: Avoid buildings that appear structurally unsound until they have been inspected by professionals.</li>
			<li>Avoid Driving: Don’t drive unless it is absolutely necessary, as roads may be blocked or damaged.</li>
			<li>Don’t Drink Tap Water Until Safe: Avoid drinking tap water until authorities have confirmed it is safe to do so.</li>
			 </ol>
